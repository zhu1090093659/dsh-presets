/**
 * tool-surface — free the preset's context window from every global tool the
 * preset does not declare.
 *
 * Shipped copy: identical in behaviour to `lib/index.js` of the bundle at
 * https://github.com/Xeraph627/local-lite (the npm-distribution form of this
 * same preset). Only that file's `@module` tag differs, because this copy is
 * addressed as a preset-directory file rather than through a package entry
 * point. It has no imports, so this single file is the whole plugin.
 *
 * `ctx.tools.restrict()` masks a scope's GLOBAL tools while leaving that scope's
 * own registrations visible, which is the seam this preset needs: the mounting
 * context is the preset's standing scope, so one `deny` computed here covers
 * every agent joined under it.
 *
 * WHY THIS SHIPS INSIDE THE BUNDLE PACKAGE, not beside the patch and not as a
 * sibling dependency. A row name that is a path never resolves here: the Host's
 * patch parser anchors `insert` rows and `group: true` children only, so inside
 * a preset declaration's `config.plugins` a `.mjs` path reaches the Loader
 * unresolvable — relative stays a relative string, and absolute stays a bare
 * filesystem path rather than a `file://` URL. The row's fiber is then never
 * created and the registry's audit fails the ENTIRE preset with "never
 * started". A bare specifier is the only thing that works, and it must be THIS
 * package's own name: a `link:`/`file:` dependency of a bundle is not installed
 * transitively, because the profile symlinks the bundle folder and never
 * installs the bundle's own dependencies — a nested package would be missing on
 * every other machine.
 *
 * The deny list is COMPUTED, never hardcoded. A hardcoded list of globally
 * mounted tools (SSH controls, workspace dependency paths, and whatever the
 * deployment adds next) would be stale the moment the profile changes, and
 * `restrict()` THROWS on an unknown name — so a stale entry would break the
 * preset instead of quietly costing tokens. Instead:
 *
 *   deny = { names in the global view }
 *        - { names this preset registers itself }   // `ownTools` below
 *        - { keep }                                 // config escape hatch
 *        + { alsoDeny }                             // config escape hatch
 *
 * The global view is read with no scope argument, so it contains global
 * registrations only — never this preset's own tools. `ownTools` is subtracted
 * anyway, because `restrict()` also rejects a name that is scope-local, and
 * every failure path logs and returns: a preset whose surface could not be
 * trimmed still composes, it just pays the tokens.
 *
 * Measured on this deployment before the trim: 19 tools / ~2,969 schema tokens,
 * of which the six `ssh_*` controls and `load_workspace_dependencies` are not
 * part of this preset and cost ~1,249 of them.
